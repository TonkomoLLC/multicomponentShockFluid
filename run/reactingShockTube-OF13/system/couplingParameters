EXTERNAL COUPLED OPTIONS
========================
coupling                  can be "plug" or "channel" or "off"   
postCFDRegion             set to "on" if there is a 3D CFD fluid region down-
                          stream of an externally coupled channel
minimizeYEqn              can be "yes" (solve YEqn at repetition factor),or "no"
                          solve YEqn at every time step
                          Note: set to "no" for internal mode
coupledOultets            can be "on" or "off" - set to "on" for external coupling
fluidCoupledName          for "postCFDRegion," name the FLUID region upstream of 
                          the externally coupled channel. If no "postCFDRegion"
                          then leave as "FLUID"
fluid2CoupledName         for "postCFDRegion," name the FLUID region downstream of 
                          the externally coupled channel. If no "postCFDRegion"
                          then leave as "FLUID2"
solidCoupledName          Name of the SOLID region transferring heat with the 
                          externally coupled channel.    
sleepTimeAfterCalc        Wait time in seconds, important if running externally
                          coupled channels in parallel.  Forces DUO to wait for
                          some set time to ensure all external channel calculations
                          are finished before proceeding
multiRelaxationFactors    If true, set a relaxation factor for each species transport
                          equation, e.g., (CH4|O2|CO|CO2|H2|H2O).  If false (default)
                          there is one relaxation parameter (Yi) for all species.
directionOfPatches        x or y or z
numberOfDetchemTubes      number of tubes to calculate in DETCHEM
lengthOfDetchemTubes      lenght of the tubes in [m]
